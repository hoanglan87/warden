[All Commits](https://github.com/davidalger/warden/compare/0.2.0..0.2.1)

**Upgrade Notes:**

If you're upgrading from version 0.1.x to 0.2.x for the first time, please reference upgrade notes for [Warden 0.2.0](https://docs.warden.dev/changelog.html#version-0-2-0-2020-01-27) and plan accordingly.

**Enhancements:**

* Added support for using `~/.warden/.env` to configure aspects of Global Services ([see docs for details](https://docs.warden.dev/services.html)) (issue [#13](https://github.com/davidalger/warden/issues/13))
* Updated `sync start` to no longer call `mutagen daemon start` as Mutagen now does this automatically.
* Updated `warden install` to include short hostname in the common name used when signing the Root CA used by Warden allowing easier identification and interoperability when a single user is running Warden across multiple workstations.

## Version [0.2.0](https://github.com/davidalger/warden/tree/0.2.0) (2020-01-27)
[All Commits](https://github.com/davidalger/warden/compare/0.1.12..0.2.0)

**Upgrade Notes:**

As mentioned below this release of Warden brings with it an update to Traefik 2.1. The v2 line of Traefik completely overhauled the labelling system used to define routes. It also opens the door to new possibilities. All labeling on built-in environment configurations has been updated for compatibility with new versions of Traefik. However, this is a **breaking change** in the two following scenarios:

* The `local` environment type is being used. When `local` env type is used, all config is contained in the project's `.warden/` directory and routes setup via labels on the custom containers will naturally need to be updated.
* Projects using custom labels applied via override files such as `.warden/warden-env.yml` may need to be updated.

Please reference the updated [base environment definitions](https://github.com/davidalger/warden/tree/develop/environments) for examples of how to update the labels on custom definitions.

Environments referencing `laravel.conf` in custom configuration within `.warden` directory must update their configuration to reference the generic `application.conf` instead as the file was renamed in the Nginx image for re-use in the future on additional environment types.

Docker images have all been re-located and/or mirrored to Quay with all built-in environment types having been updated to reference the images at the new location. Images currently on Docker Hub will remain available in order to preserve functionality of Warden 0.1.x release line, but will no longer be updated and compatibility with all functionality in Warden 0.2.0 is not guaranteed. Where these images are referenced in per-project configuration within the `.warden` directory, it is strongly suggested these references be updated to use images at the new locations:

* [https://quay.io/repository/warden/varnish?tab=tags](https://quay.io/repository/warden/varnish?tab=tags)
* [https://quay.io/repository/warden/redis?tab=tags](https://quay.io/repository/warden/redis?tab=tags)
* [https://quay.io/repository/warden/rabbitmq?tab=tags](https://quay.io/repository/warden/rabbitmq?tab=tags)
* [https://quay.io/repository/warden/php-fpm?tab=tags](https://quay.io/repository/warden/php-fpm?tab=tags)
* [https://quay.io/repository/warden/nginx?tab=tags](https://quay.io/repository/warden/nginx?tab=tags)
* [https://quay.io/repository/warden/mariadb?tab=tags](https://quay.io/repository/warden/mariadb?tab=tags)
* [https://quay.io/repository/warden/mailhog?tab=tags](https://quay.io/repository/warden/mailhog?tab=tags)
* [https://quay.io/repository/warden/elasticsearch?tab=tags](https://quay.io/repository/warden/elasticsearch?tab=tags)

**Enhancements:**
* Added native support for multi-domain projects without requiring per-project routing configuration. This is accomplished using wildcard rules in the new Traefik labeling configuration allowing Warden to automatically route any sub-domain of the `TRAEFIK_DOMAIN` value in `.env` to the nginx and/or varnish container for handling by the application.
* Added `warden debug` command which launches user into Xdebug enabled `php-debug` container for debugging CLI based workflows (issue [#33](https://github.com/davidalger/warden/issues/33); [#35](https://github.com/davidalger/warden/pull/35) by [molotovbliss](https://github.com/molotovbliss))
* Added labels to `fpm` containers in `magento2` environment to support use of Live Reload via an injected JS snippet in the site header or footer (issue [#62](https://github.com/davidalger/warden/issues/62))
* Added `WARDEN_ENV_NAME` as prefix to each container hostname in compose configs (issue [#29](https://github.com/davidalger/warden/issues/29))
* Added `BYPASS_VARNISH` flag which when set in project `.env` file will cause Traefik to route requests directly to `nginx` container rather than `varnish` (issue [#63](https://github.com/davidalger/warden/issues/63))
* Added `laravel` environment type to support local development of Laravel based applications (issue [#60](https://github.com/davidalger/warden/issues/60))
* Added Allure reporting support to Selenium setup for MFTF ([#69](https://github.com/davidalger/warden/pull/69) by [lbajsarowicz](https://github.com/lbajsarowicz))
* Updated Traefik container and configuration to deploy Traefik 2.1; this is a **potentially breaking change** as Traefik v2 overhauled the labeling used to auto-configure routing on containers. All labeling on built-in environment configurations has been updated, but where labels are used to configure Traefik in per-project configuration files such as in `.warden/warden-env.yml` the project may require a coordinated update to labeling for continued interoperability of the customizations with Warden 0.2.0+
* Updated Mutagen usage to rely on new commands and configuration in Mutagen 0.10+ (Warden will now throw an error if you attempt to start a sync and have a version of Mutagen older than 0.10.3 installed)
* Updated configuration setup for SSH tunnel container so it will automatically re-instate the needed configuration (if missing) when running `up`, `start`, or `restart` to mitigate issue caused by macOS Catalina updates wiping out customizations to `/etc/ssh/ssh_config` (issue [#59](https://github.com/davidalger/warden/issues/59))
* Updated `env-init` command to include default values for available variables in the project's `.env` making customization a bit easier (issue [#32](https://github.com/davidalger/warden/issues/32))
* Updated default Elasticsearch version for `magento2` environments from 5.4 to 6.8 (issue [#66](https://github.com/davidalger/warden/issues/66))
* Updated Selenium setup for MFTF to use hub and headless nodes by default (issue [#67](https://github.com/davidalger/warden/issues/67); [#68](https://github.com/davidalger/warden/pull/68) by [lbajsarowicz](https://github.com/lbajsarowicz))
* Updated environment templates to pass `TRAEFIK_DOMAIN` and `TRAEFIK_SUBDOMAIN` into `php-fpm` and `php-debug` for use in documented install routine (issue [#42](https://github.com/davidalger/warden/issues/42))
* Updated default PHP version for `magento2` environments from 7.2 to 7.3 (issue [#75](https://github.com/davidalger/warden/issues/75))
* Updated default Varnish version for `magento2` environments from 4.1 to 6.0 (LTS)
* Changed `laravel.conf` in nginx image to generic `application.conf`
* Updated defaults for nginx on `magento2` environments to be set in the docker env vs built into the nginx image; the image now defaults to loading the generic `application.conf` with `/var/www/html` as webroot

**Bug fixes:**
* Fixed broken incorrect Blackfire environment template name for magento1 env type (issue [#48](https://github.com/davidalger/warden/issues/48))
* Fixed inability to get help content specific to env sub-commands using `warden env <command> -h`

## Version [0.1.11](https://github.com/davidalger/warden/tree/0.1.11) (2019-11-26)
[All Commits](https://github.com/davidalger/warden/compare/0.1.10..0.1.11)

**Enhancements:**
* Added option to enable and setup Selenium for use with MFTF via flag in project's `.env` file ([#40](https://github.com/davidalger/warden/pull/40) by [lbajsarowicz](https://github.com/lbajsarowicz))
* Added error message to `warden install` when `docker-compose` version in `$PATH` is incompatible ([#41](https://github.com/davidalger/warden/pull/41) by [lbajsarowicz](https://github.com/lbajsarowicz))

## Version [0.1.10](https://github.com/davidalger/warden/tree/0.1.10) (2019-09-23)

* Added native support to Warden for using the [split-database system](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/config-guide/multi-master/multi-master.html) in Magento Commerce during local development ([#5](https://github.com/davidalger/warden/pull/5) by [navarr](https://github.com/navarr))
* Added support for optional Blackfire profiling which can be enabled via settings in the project's `.env` file ([#12](https://github.com/davidalger/warden/pull/12) by [navarr](https://github.com/navarr))

## Version [0.1.9](https://github.com/davidalger/warden/tree/0.1.9) (2019-09-19)

* Pinned image for Traefik to use `traefik:v1.7` imgae vs `traefik:latest` to resolve issues caused by Traefik 2.0 having breaking changes in the configuration API

## Version [0.1.8](https://github.com/davidalger/warden/tree/0.1.8) (2019-09-06)

* Introduced `NODE_VERSION` environment variable to specify which version of NodeJS to install in FPM images during container startup (by default v10 is now pre-installed in `mage1-fpm` and `mage2-fpm` images at the time of this release; latest images must be pulled from Docker Hub for this to work).
* Fixed issue where if sub-directory included a relative symlink pointing `.env` at parent project's `.env` file, `--project-dir` passed to `docker-compose` could be specified incorrectly when running warden from within the given sub-directory.

## Version [0.1.7](https://github.com/davidalger/warden/tree/0.1.7) (2019-08-23)

* All published ports now listen on `127.0.0.1` by default as opposed to `0.0.0.0` for a local environment that is fully inaccessible to the outside world apart from using a proxy (such as [Charles](https://www.charlesproxy.com/)).

## Version [0.1.6](https://github.com/davidalger/warden/tree/0.1.6) (2019-08-10)

* Changed the default value `env-init` uses for `TRAEFIK_SUBDOMAIN` to `app` (previously it would match the environment type)
* Added mount of `~/.warden/ssl/rootca/certs:/etc/ssl/warden-rootca-cert:ro` to each env type's `php-fpm` and `php-debug` containers to support FPM images appending this CA root to the trusted ca-bundle on container start
* Added `extra_hosts` entry to set an entry in `/etc/hosts` within `php-fpm` and `php-debug` containers pointing the project's primary domain to the Traefik service IP address so `curl` and `SoapClient` (for example) may work inside a project's FPM services
* Added FPM containers to the "warden" network so they'll be able to route http requests to Traefik

## Version [0.1.5](https://github.com/davidalger/warden/tree/0.1.5) (2019-07-19)

* Changed Mutagen polling interval from 20 to 10 seconds
* Removed `generated` directory from exclusions in Mutagen sync configuration (having this ignored breaks ability to step into generated class files during Xdebug sessions)
* Fixed issue with Mutagen sync cofiguration causing `pub/static` (and other files) to have incorrect permissions resulting in 404'ing static resources
* Fixed issue causing `warden env` to break when run from a path which contained a space (issue [#3](https://github.com/davidalger/warden/issues/3))

## Version [0.1.4](https://github.com/davidalger/warden/tree/0.1.4) (2019-07-15)

* Removed exclusion of 'node_modules' from Mutagen sync for Magento 2 to avoid breaking Dotdigitalgroup_Email module in vendor directory (this module includes a node_modules dir pre-installed).

## Version [0.1.3](https://github.com/davidalger/warden/tree/0.1.3) (2019-07-10)

* Added ability on linux to prevent warden from touching dns configuration when `~/.warden/nodnsconfig` is present.
* Updated install routine to properly trust CA root on Ubuntu (previously warden install would simply fail)
* Updated DNS auto-configuration on linux systems to handle systemd-resolved usage.
* Fixed issue on Ubuntu where dnsmasq container would fail to bind to port 53.
* Fixed issue where lack of `~/.composer` dir (resulting in creation by docker) can cause permissions error inside containers.
* Fixed issue with `bin/magento setup:install` allowing it to pass permissions checks ([#2](https://github.com/davidalger/warden/pull/2) by [fooman](https://github.com/fooman))
* Fixed issue where `env` and `env-init` commands failed to reset shell colors when printing error messages (issue [#4](https://github.com/davidalger/warden/issues/4))

## Version [0.1.2](https://github.com/davidalger/warden/tree/0.1.2) (2019-07-03)

* Added `warden shell` command for easily dropping into the `php-fpm` container (container name is configurable for supporting "local" environment types)
* Added `max_allowed_packet=1024M` to `db` containers for M1 and M2 environments to avoid imports or upgrade routines from failing on large packets.
* Changed `php-fpm` and `php-debug` to use custom images based on `centos:7` as opposed to the `alpine3.9` based official php-fpm images to avoid seg-faults when Source Guardian loader is installed alongside Xdebug.
* Fixed issue with DEFINER stripping in `db import` allowing it to correctly strip from both TRIGGERS and ALGORITHM clauses.

## Version [0.1.1](https://github.com/davidalger/warden/tree/0.1.1) (2019-06-27)

* Fixed bug where 'db' commands broke due to template overhaul in 0.1.0 release.

## Version [0.1.0](https://github.com/davidalger/warden/tree/0.1.0) (2019-06-27)

* Changed the env type setup to automatically include additional configuration based on $OSTYPE.
* Changed the environment template structure to utilize per-OSTYPE docker-compose config additions where environments differ from one host OS to another (such as `magento2` env type, which uses plain mounts on `linux-gnu` but sync sessions on `darwin`)
* Fixed a few error messages so they won't change shell text color permanently when they output.
* Fixed sync command to output error message when any sub-command is run on an env lacking a mutagen configuration.

## Version [0.1.0-beta7](https://github.com/davidalger/warden/tree/0.1.0-beta7)

* Added Xdebug support via additional `php-debug` container which Nginx routes to based on presence of `XDEBUG_SESSION` cookie.
* Fixed Elasticsearch images used in Magento 2 environment templates and configured for lower overall memory utilization upon container start for a smaller env footprint.

## Version [0.1.0-beta6](https://github.com/davidalger/warden/tree/0.1.0-beta6)

* Added support for extending environment configuration on a per-project basis via `.warden/warden-env.yml` and `.warden/warden-env.<WARDEN_ENV_TYPE>.yml` files
* Added `local` env type to support projects which do not conform to any of the templated environments suppoprted out-of-the-box
* Changed Traefik configuration to automatically use the warden docker network (eliminates need for `traefik.docker.network=warden` label on all proxied containers
* Changed Traefik configuration to require containers be explicitly enabled for Traefik via the label `traefik.enable=true`
* Changed docker-compose environment type templates to version 3.5 for better extendability in project override files
* Fixed bug where resolver setup on macOS would fail if `/etc/resolver` dir was already present during install ([#1](https://github.com/davidalger/warden/pull/1) by [fooman](https://github.com/fooman))

## Version [0.1.0-beta5](https://github.com/davidalger/warden/tree/0.1.0-beta5)

## Version [0.1.0-beta4](https://github.com/davidalger/warden/tree/0.1.0-beta4)

* Added "env" command for controlling docker based per-project environments (currently this simply passes all commands and arguments through to docker-compose).
* Added "env-init" to add `.env` file with Warden configuration to the current working directory.
* Added "sync" command with start/stop/list sub-commands for controlling per-project mutagen sessions.
* Added "db" command for connecting to mysql and importing databases into the db service.
* Added three environment types: `magento1`, `magento2-mutagen`, `magento2-native` with auto-selecting the correct M2 environment on Linux/macOS.
* Fixed dnsmasq setup on Linux (nameserver is now configured on Linux when NetworkManager service is active during install; tested on Fedora 29)

## Version [0.1.0-beta3](https://github.com/davidalger/warden/tree/0.1.0-beta3)

* Fixed infinite loop on initial setup routine.

## Version [0.1.0-beta2](https://github.com/davidalger/warden/tree/0.1.0-beta2)

* Updated assertion to automatically execute "warden install" if installed metadata indicator is older than bin/warden.
